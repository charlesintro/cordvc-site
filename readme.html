<strong>cord vc</strong>

<strong>01 — what we do</strong>
we invest at the system layer—energy, matter, compute, and data—and in the expanding application layer that builds atop it.
the former is durable, capital intensive, and directional. the latter is fast-moving, divergent, and opportunistic.
cord vc was created to move across both with focus, fluency, and respect for the unique cadence each requires.

<strong>02 — why we exist</strong>
we believe capital is a creative act.
we believe ambition, when paired with clarity, can compound into things that matter.
we believe that capitalism has a role to play in building a better world.
this fund is an attempt to act on those beliefs—deliberately, precisely, and with taste.

<strong>03 — what we invest in</strong>
foundations:
- energy infrastructure
- materials and manufacturing primitives
- compute, chip, and deployment rails
- structured data pipelines and core models

applications:
- ai-native workflows
- emergent consumer behaviors
- rethought user interfaces and interaction surfaces
- novel work or coordination patterns

<strong>04 — how we work</strong>
we invest early and with conviction.
we move quickly, ask good questions, and stay out of the way.
we bring experience scaling product from zero to billions.
we engage when helpful—and disappear when not.

<strong>05 — if you’re a founder</strong>
you should reach out if:
- you know what you want to build and why it matters
- you want a thought partner who has built and shipped real products
- you want capital that brings clarity, not noise

<strong>06 — if you’re an LP</strong>
this fund is high-conviction and low-friction.
we offer exposure to infrastructure-grade foundations and fast-moving applications—with judgment earned through experience.
interested LPs can reach out directly.

<strong>07 — roots</strong>
cord is led by a multi-time builder and operator with experience taking products from idea to $1B+ outcomes.
we started this fund not to play the game, but to work with the few who are rewriting it.
