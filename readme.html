<strong>cord vc</strong>

<strong>01 — what we do</strong>
we invest in foundations—energy, materials, compute, and data—and in the applications built on top.
some bets compound over time. others move quickly.
we work across both with the fluency, focus, and context each layer demands.

<strong>02 — how we work</strong>
we invest early and with conviction.
we move quickly and bring practical, hard-won experience.
we stay close to the work and build long-term relationships with the teams we back.

<strong>03 — who we are</strong>
cord is led by a repeat builder with experience taking products from idea to scaled outcomes.
we started this fund to support teams solving meaningful problems and building the next generation of systems.
